# Exploring Category Theory with Julia & Catlab.jl

This repository contains code and exercises exploring **Category Theory**, particularly using the **Julia programming language** and the **Catlab.jl** library. The goal is to work through the mathematical concepts **line by line** and provide clear implementations.

## Getting Started

To run the provided examples, ensure that **Julia** and the required packages are installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
Install Julia if you havenâ€™t already: [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
Then, install Catlab.jl, and all other packages

_## For Excercises in chapter one in the book: Seven Sketches in Compositionality " https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316 "##_
  1. Test that Julia is running on your machine by running the Test.jl file
  3. Test that Catlab.jl is installed by running the CatLab_test.jl file
  4. Run the file PartitionLattice.jl
  *Note* Ensure that all neccassary packages are installed
